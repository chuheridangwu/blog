Nigel is our new next-door neighbour. He's a pilot.
He was in the R.A.F.
He will fly to New York next month.
The month after next he'll fly to Tokyo.
At the moment, he's in Madrid. He flew to Spain a week ago.
He'll return to London the week after next.
He's only forty-one years old, and he has already been to nearly every country in the world.
Nigel is a very lucky man. But his wife isn't very lucky. She usually stays at home!


奈杰尔是我们新搬来的隔壁邻居。他是个飞行员。 他曾在皇家空军任职。 下个月他将飞往纽约。 再下个月他将飞往东京。 现在他在马德里。他是一星期以前飞到西班牙的。 再下个星期他将返回伦敦。 他只有41岁，但他却过世界上几乎每一个国家。 奈杰尔是个很幸运的人。但他的妻子运气不很好。他总是呆在家里！
