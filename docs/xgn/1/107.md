ASSISTANT: Do you like this dress, madam?
LADY: I like the colour very much.
It's lovely dress,
but it's too small for me.
ASSISTANT: What about this one?
It's lovely dress.
It's very smart.
Short skirts are in fashion
now.
Would you like to try it?
LADY: All right.
LADY: I'm afraid this green dress
it too small for me as well.
It's smaller than the blue
one.
LADY: I don't like the colour
either. It doesn't suit me
at all. I think the blue
dress is prettier.
LADY: Could you show me another
blue dress? I want a dress
like that one, but it must
be my size.
ASSISTANT: I'm afraid I haven't got
a larger dress.
This is the largest dress
in the shop.


店员：夫人，您喜欢这件衣服吗？
女士：我很喜欢这颜色。这件漂亮的衣服， 可是对我来说太小了。
店员：这件怎么样？这是件漂亮的衣服， 它很时髦。短裙现在很流行。 您要试一试吗？
女士：好吧。
店员：恐怕这件绿色的我穿着也太小了。 它比那件蓝色的还要小。
女士：我也不喜欢这种颜色。这颜色我穿 根本不合适。我认为那件蓝色的更 漂亮些。
女士：您能再给我看一件蓝色的吗？ 我想一件和那件一样的， 但必须是我的尺寸。
店员：恐怕没有更大的了。 这是店里最大一件
